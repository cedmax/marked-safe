## Marked safe generator

A very rough first draft of a Facebook marked safe generator, inspired by [a tweet](https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/847073457795977220) by Chris Heilmann.

Add the data on the left (including the images from your profile and for the awful event) and press save on the right, when you are set. You will get to download an image matching what you generated.
